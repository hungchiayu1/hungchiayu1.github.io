I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in May 2024. I am an incoming PhD student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), fortunately to be advised [Prof. Soujanya Poria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oS6gRc4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interest lies in Large Language Models and MultiModals. Throughout my undergraduate period, I was fortunate to have opportunity to conduct research under [Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uQxdOlsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Soujanya Poria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oS6gRc4AAAAJ&hl=en).
